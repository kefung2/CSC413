Our purple boy lazarus got capture by Mr.Evil and they are trying to kill you.
You goal is to avoid the dropping box and go up and press the stop button. 

Each box have it own weight from the lowest to highest is:
Cardboard, Wood, Metal, and Stone

If a heavier box get on top of a lighter box it will crush the box. 

So as you control lazarus to escape from Mr.Evil watch out for that. 

However, there is another thing you have to watch out for!
This lazarus is a lazy lazarus who do not like to jump, so there is no way for him to move up, but luckily this lazarus is special, he can activate his special power to all a lot of things, and when Mr.Evil see you use your special power, he will drop boxes faster and more frequent.
