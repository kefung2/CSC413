The goal of this game is to kill the other tank. HOWEVER,
You will NOT respawn after you lose all you hp.

Your will have your hp reset and life -1, no respawn mean 
no respawn invincible frame after you lose all your HP.

Given the fact that you will not respawn and to make sure player won't
abuse that, as soon as one bullet hit something ALL your bullet will disappear,
So no spam fire available.
